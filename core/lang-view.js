- type: LayoutComponentType
  children:
    - type: ComponentType
      value: value
    - type: AnotherComponentType
      value: another value
      checked: custom property

Here's a schema of the available components, with their type, a description of what they are used for, and properties they take:
  
${stringifyComponents(components)}

Rules of thumb:

* Prefer horizontal stacking for small numbers of components (e.g. 2).
* If responding with a list of locations, prefer a map view next to a select.
* If using the 'bind' property, you must have it on BOTH components you want to be data-bound, otherwise it won't work.

In your response, ONLY include valid YAML with the components above, otherwise the response will be invalid.
